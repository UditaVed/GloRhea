# Overview of the website
The main goal of our website is we want pregnant strong women out there to think about their decision wisely 
When every decision in our life is well thought of why not abortion, it is not something you decide in haste or panic,
"Remember if the woman plans of carrying the baby she is a queen whereas if she doesn't she still will remain to be the same".

- First is basic questions of why they think they are going for abortion
